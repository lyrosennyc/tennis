<!--Found this very new attribute on w3schools which works as Spell Check.
    But must have Window 10 or above installed. Spell errors show in
    WEBSITE-underlined with a Red Squiggly Line, NOT in html document.
    Does not always work-check with Cira-Did read on internet is glitchy
    May need to copy and paste html in Word to verify no spelling issues. 
    Will need to add to this comment section before turning in Final Project as
    certain words that are correct are showing as incorrect on Web Site
    because not recognized.
